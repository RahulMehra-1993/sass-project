/* ///Saas major funtionality///
1-declaration of code and writting it is easy
2-we use Scss methodolgy to write sass code than actual sass methodoly because thats more difficult to read code
3-nesting should not be exceeding up to 3rd layer or it will make code messy
4-@mixin is used to create a variable with more than 1 properties inside it and also can have parameters or argument
to chnage its properties ;@include is used to define that @mixin variable isnside any css element
5-sass have some salient features like we can use color them to lighter medium darker with the %age
6-@extend is used to dry up the code just like @mixin but its better to avoid @extend
7-we can also use %function to craete custome functions for re-useablity
8-installation- npm install node-sass --save-dev for development only
